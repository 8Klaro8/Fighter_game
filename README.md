# Fighter_game

# About this project
 - This is a project inspired by a team project I did with my fellow teammates as a final exam under a big tech firm.

# Goal
 - The goal was to imporve myself and have insight into those parts I did not participate directly during the development phase.

# About the game
 - You will get automatically a fighter once you login/register, then you are able to choose action-event pairs to fight with in the arena.
 - Once you choosed your strategy you are able to send your fighter to fight and from that point you have no control over your fighter, only the strategy you implanted earlier.

# Further development
 - Preserve killing/ survining points after each match/death.
 - Preserve points once the game ends/closed.
 - Add more action/event to the game.
 - Create better balance among the chosen strategies.
 - Limit strategies to be chosen.

# Bugs
 - No current bug is known
